### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently training to be a Software Developer with the amazing [Northcoders Coding Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/), where I'm learning all about JS, PSQL, HTML, CSS, and React.

Fun fact: I'm a slow-cooker legend - just ask *anyone* about my chicken shawarma wraps! :stuffed_flatbread:
